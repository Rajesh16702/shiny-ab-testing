## Shiny AB Test Dashboard

[https://github.com/shane-kercheval/shiny-ab-testing](https://github.com/shane-kercheval/shiny-ab-testing)

This shiny app is an example of an A/B test dashboard that uses both frequentist and bayesian methods.

The underlying data it uses is simulated to be "realistic", such that it could process production-level data.

Additionally, the underlying code/functions/logic is unit-tested and is designed to be extendable and maintainable.
